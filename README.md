GetMyAliases, GetMyCommands, GetModuleDetails and QuickList are functions used to pull information from the modules directories recursively, in order to find relevant details about all user generated content and display them in various table formats for reference.
These are not interactive commands, although I've made the configuration for GetMyCommands configurable via an external PSD1 file.
